        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "In the evolution of generative artificial intelligence, two distinct architectural paradigms have emerged as dominant forces within their respective modalities:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Transformers**, as the principal backbone of language and multimodal text generation, and  \n",
        "- **Diffusion models**, as the prevailing framework for image and visual content synthesis.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This bifurcation reflects deep structural and statistical differences between **symbolic-sequential data** (language, code, reasoning) and **continuous perceptual data** (images, audio, video).  \n",
        "The former benefits from contextual dependency modeling via attention mechanisms, while the latter requires gradual denoising to approximate complex high-dimensional distributions.\n",

        "## 2. Transformers: The Linguistic Revolution\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1. Theoretical Foundations\n",
        "The Transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in *“Attention Is All You Need”* (NeurIPS 2017), replaced recurrence and convolution with self-attention mechanisms.  \n",
        "This enabled parallelized sequence processing and long-range dependency modeling—critical for linguistic coherence and reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core Innovations**\n",
        "- **Self-Attention:** Captures contextual relationships between tokens, independent of sequence distance.  \n",
        "- **Positional Encoding:** Introduces sequential order without recurrence.  \n",
        "- **Scalability:** Enables efficient parallel training across billions of tokens.  \n",

        "\n",
