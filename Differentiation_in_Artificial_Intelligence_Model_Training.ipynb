        "\n",
        "During the training of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Deep Learning model, **differentiation**—the mathematical process of computing derivatives—plays a central and indispensable role.  \n",
        "Every adjustment the model makes to improve its predictions depends on calculating how sensitive each parameter (weight, bias, etc.) is to the overall error.  \n",
        "This process is known as **backpropagation**, and it systematically applies the **chain rule of calculus** through all the functions that compose the model.\n",
