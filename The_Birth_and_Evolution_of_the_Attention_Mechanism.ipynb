        "Understanding the birth and evolution of the attention mechanism is key to grasping how modern neural architectures like the Transformer and large language models (LLMs) arose.  \n",

        "Before attention, neural sequence models used fixed-length vector encodings.  \n",
        "In *Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks* (Sutskever et al., 2014), the encoder compressed an entire source sentence into a single vector — a bottleneck for long sequences.  \n",
