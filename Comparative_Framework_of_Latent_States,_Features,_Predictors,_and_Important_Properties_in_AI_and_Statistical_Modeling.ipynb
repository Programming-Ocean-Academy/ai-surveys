        "## Latent States\n",
        "**Definition:**  \n",
        "Latent states are hidden or unobserved variables within a model. They are not directly measurable from the data but are assumed to exist to explain the observed patterns.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Role:**  \n",
        "They capture abstract or compressed representations that influence the observed data. For example:  \n",
        "- In Hidden Markov Models, the latent state is the hidden label generating the observations.  \n",
        "- In Variational Autoencoders, the latent vector represents a compressed code of the input.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Nature:**  \n",
        "- They are discovered by the model during training.  \n",
        "- They are difficult to interpret directly by humans.  \n",
        "- They are central to generative models and unsupervised learning.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:**  \n",
        "- Topic vectors in NLP.  \n",

        "## Features\n",
        "**Definition:**  \n",
        "Features are measurable characteristics or attributes of the data used as input to a model. They describe the data in a way the model can process.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Role:**  \n",
        "Features form the raw input space for learning. The model identifies patterns and relationships between features and targets.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Nature:**  \n",
        "- Can be raw (e.g., pixel intensities) or engineered (e.g., TF-IDF scores, polynomial features).  \n",
        "- Directly interpretable by humans when designed explicitly.  \n",
        "- Feature extraction can be automated (deep learning) or manual (classical ML).  \n",

        "**Definition:**  \n",
        "Predictors (or regressors in regression analysis) are independent variables explicitly chosen to model the relationship with the target (dependent variable).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Role:**  \n",
        "They are the inputs fed into the model with the intent to explain or predict the output. In regression, they appear on the right-hand side of the equation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Nature:**  \n",
        "- Always human-selected (though feature selection may prune them).  \n",
        "- Mathematically explicit in equations (e.g., \\( y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 \\)).  \n",
        "- Part of hypothesis-driven modeling.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:**  \n",
        "- In predicting house prices: size, location, and number of rooms as regressors.  \n",
        "- In linear regression: explanatory variables that influence the dependent variable.  \n",

        "## Important Properties\n",
        "**Definition:**  \n",
        "Important properties are the aspects or characteristics of features, regressors, or latent states that exert the strongest influence on the modelâ€™s predictions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Role:**  \n",
        "They reveal which variables or dimensions matter most for the task. This can mean statistical significance, variance contribution, or learned importance.  \n",

        "**Nature:**  \n",
        "- Emerges from analysis or model training.  \n",
        "- Can apply to both observed features and hidden latent variables.  \n",
        "- Bridges human interpretability with model behavior.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:**  \n",
        "- Principal components in PCA (directions of maximum variance).  \n",
        "- Attention weights in Transformers (highlighting salient tokens).  \n",
