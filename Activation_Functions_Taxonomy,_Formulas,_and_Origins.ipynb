        "| **Hard Branching (Logical If/Else)** | Function has explicit conditions like `if x>0` leading to discontinuous control flow. | ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Hard Tanh, Hard Sigmoid, Hard Swish, Step, Sign | Causes warp divergence. Threads take different paths → serialized execution. Discontinuous derivatives hurt convergence. |\n",
        "| **Soft Branching (Analytical Transition)** | Function mimics branching (e.g. saturating from 0→1) but through continuous math (`exp`, `tanh`, `erf`). | Sigmoid, Tanh, GELU, ELU, Softplus | Branch-free but computationally heavy. Smooth gradients help convergence, but high FLOP cost per element. |\n",
        "| **Saturation** | Function approaches fixed limits as |x|→∞; derivative → 0 (gradient vanishes). | Sigmoid, Tanh, GELU, Softsign | No warp divergence, but training slows due to vanishing gradients. Hardware fine, learning dynamics hurt. |\n",
